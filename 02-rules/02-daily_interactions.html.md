title: Daily Interactions
```

As a member of Mangrove, you interact in real life and online with other members, on a daily basis. In this sense, Mangrove is almost a lifestyle.

### Physical interactions
Mangrove members regularly interact in real life through **local hubs** (Paris, Berlin, San Francisco). Those who can work remotely gather in the same **workplace** to spend the day together. Drinks and dinners, and other **events** are often organised. We also teach each other during **learning nights**.

**Once every few months**, we gather at a **retreat** somewhere in the world, where people from different hubs mix. We typically rent a nice and spacious house or villa for a few weeks, in an relaxing and isolaled place. We spend time getting to know each other, helping each other on our projects, and working remotely. 

### Online interactions
You may be **travelling** sometimes, especially if you have a nomad lifestyle, or not be able to participate a lot to you hub’s life due to your activity, or **live far** from a Mangrove hub. This is why we also keep **rich online interactions** on Slack, building a strong sense of community through daily conversations and interactions tools.
