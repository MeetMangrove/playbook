### Always keeping in mind its purpose 

Always keeping in mind the purpose of the organization is key. The only final boss of Mangrove's members is Mangrove's purpose, and only important decision should be made under the light of this purpose. Members' work should converge towards it.


### Sharing its ideal

Members sharing a common strong culture is at the very root of Mangrove's existence. Before everything else, a member shares with Mangrove an ideal of what is a fulfilling professional life, and Mangrove's bets on how to achieve it. [see section 'What is Mangrove']
