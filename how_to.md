# How To


### Impact existing assets
Existing assets include: website, bots, branding.
Ask the advice of the person leading the asset and other members who are expert on the topic about the change you’d like to make.
If you still want to make it and some people are against, ask for a vote (each voter being pondered by each member’s public influence based on contribution) and if you get less than 30% of voters against the change (yes, no, IDK), you can make it.


### Buy something for mangrove

When it has been decided that something has to be bought by you for Mangrove, please consider the following steps: 

1. Choose the best item regarding the needs
2. Validate it with your team on the associated project
3. If you have enough money to buy it, go for it. If not, divide the total amount with other teammates. Announce the expense in the #finance channel so that the treasurer can take it into account. 
4. Every month (?), finances are publicly communicated by the treasurer in order to balance the member contributions, so you can see who owes you money. However, you are responsible to ask for your refunds, and if needed, go through a conflict resolution process [see link]


### Onboard a mangrove friend
After 2 Mangrove members agreed on inviting a new person to the community because she shares our values and works in the tech industry, one of them needs to explain her what is the MF community and ask her if she wants to join. If she agrees, she has to fill this form: [http://bit.ly/newmf_](http://bit.ly/newmf_)

Then, the 1st member who suggested her as an MF will add her on the MF Slack and write an introduction in #general as soon as she joins.
Ex: Hey all, I’m glad to introduce you to [name]. I met her/him [somewhere]. (S)he’s skilled at [top 3 skills]. Her/his background in a few words [///]. Follow her on Twitter here: [account].

Then, this same member will send the new MF a private message to:
- ask her to add a profile picture as it's more friendly
- share with her the link to the MF directory ([http://bit.ly/MF_directory](http://bit.ly/MF_directory)) and tell her not to hesitate to get in touch with anyone in the community
- share with her the Slack channels that could be interesting to her (for instance: #dev, #ux, etc.)


### Start a new project
When you want to start a new project, you need to:
- ask for advice from the people who will get impacted by your project.
- ask for advice from the people who are the most skilled to help you.
- share publicly about the project you are starting if people want to participate.

### Animate mangrove friends

As a Mangrove member, you'll have to ensure that the MF community is well-animated by posting regularly, giving feedbacks and helping people.
